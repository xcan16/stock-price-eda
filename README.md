This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a stock price dataset, including technical indicators and time series features.

## Dataset
- 1857 rows, 21 columns
- Features: price (open, high, low, close, adjclose), volume, RSI, returns, lagged features, trend (target)

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. Data Validation and Quality Checks
3. Price and Technical Indicator Analysis
